This project aims to allow any type of device to be controlled by a common web interface (IR, X10, etc.).

The original project is located at https://github.com/azylman/webmote and was written by Daniel Myers, Alex Wilson, and Alex Zylman. This rewrite serves to improve extensibility by using a plugin architechture with a minimal core and plugins for features or protocols.


**********************
Goals:
**********************

Extensible - plugins for new protocols and functionality

Mobile web interface - works on any browser on any platform

Simple enough for my parents (old) to setup

*Serve media connected to the server, upload to, download to, etc (this is more of a long term goal...)

**********************
Core Description:
**********************
A set of superclasses (and associated methods) for the plugins to expand on.

**********************
Plugin Description:
**********************

A set of subclasses, files and routines that expand the functionality of webmote.
The format is as follows:

A top level directory containing at least:
    templates (directory)
        html files containing pages specific to the plugin
    static    (directory)
        images, javascript, etc.
    models.py
    urls.py
    views.py
    __init__.py
    info.json
        authors
        version
        name
        url
